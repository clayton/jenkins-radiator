You shouldn't worry about\nthat so, since I will make sure this module does not break in the future by\neither patching it, or making a patch for node that makes the needed APIs\npublic.\n\n## What to do with this\n\nI use this library for dependency injection in unit tests. However, you could\nalso use it to create experimental require addons yourself.\n\n## License\n\nrequire-like is licensed under the MIT license.\n",
