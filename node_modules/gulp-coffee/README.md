## Usage

```javascript
var coffee = require('gulp-coffee');

gulp.task('coffee', function() {
  gulp.src('./src/*.coffee')
    .pipe(coffee({bare: true}).on('error', gutil.log))
    .pipe(gulp.dest('./public/'))
});
```

### Error handling

gulp-coffee will emit an error for cases such as invalid coffeescript syntax. If uncaught, the error will crash gulp.

You will need to attach a listener (i.e. `.on('error')`) for the error event emitted by gulp-coffee:

```javascript
var coffeeStream = coffee({bare: true});

// Attach listener
coffeeStream.on('error', function(err) {});
```

In addition, you may utilize [gulp-util](https://github.com/wearefractal/gulp-util)'s logging function:

```javascript
var gutil = require('gulp-util');

// ...

var coffeeStream = coffee({bare: true});

// Attach listener
coffeeStream.on('error', gutil.log);

```

Since `.on(...)` returns `this`, you can make you can compact it as inline code:

```javascript

gulp.src('./src/*.coffee')
  .pipe(coffee({bare: true}).on('error', gutil.log))
  // ...
```

## Options
